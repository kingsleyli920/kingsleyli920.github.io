Hello I am Kuncheng Li. I graduated from USC (University of Southern California) at May 10th, 2019. My major is Computer Science. I am still seeking full time Software Engineer position in the US now. 


I have learned Computer Science for more than five years during undergraduate study and master study. I took my undergraduate degree in the UK. My university is University of Essex. It located in the oldest town in UK - Colchester. 

During these a few years. I learned a lot of different kinds of technical stacks. For example, Java, Spring, Python, Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, React.js, Angular, MySQL, Redis and other kind of technologies which are belong to other technical area. My knowledge is widely enough. But I need to find out my future career direction for those technologies. And I need to learn the relevant technologies deeply.

As a result, I built and deployed this personal blog. I hope to record that kownledge points I need to remember, mistakes I have met during developing projects and my personal understanding of the technologies I have learned. 

My current plan is that to revise knowledge about Java, record the key points, errors occured during the learning period and so on. 

In the future, I will revise more and more technologies which I was learned before. 

Thank you.

Kuncheng Li
